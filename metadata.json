  "description": "I created the first spice themed community coin. It got its name from the spice that everyone uses and for almost everything, this is salt. This is the spice that we just add to food because it just makes it tastier. I made this project all by myself, so I'm asking everyone to give me a chance. I don't have much experience yet with how to manage a token, but I will learn with your help.",
